# simpleneuralnetwork
A simple neural network implementation

The neural network and backpropagation training works well. It supports both ReLU and sigmoid activation functions. For ReLU, He initialization is used for generating the initial weights. The models can be saved and loaded.

However, the code is just straight forward with no attempt to make it efficient what-so-ever. 

The code for the application is very messy.
